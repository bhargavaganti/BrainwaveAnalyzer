# Brainwave Analyzer
       
Program to import raw brainwaves, and using FFT and Frequency Index calculate various bands of brainwaves. The Brainwave Analyzer is a rough untested program.

The purpose of the Brainwave Analyzer is to provide a way to take raw brainwaves, calculate their frequencies, divide them up into the different bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma), and then graph the results.

The Brainwave Analyzer is set up to import OpenVibe csv files, and MindwaveReader512 csv files. The Brainwave Analyzer can also export results to a csv file for further analysis. 

Two versions:

## Web-Edition  (Finished)

* "Web-Edition" written in JavaScript by Nayuki


## "FFT-Graph" written in Visual C# 2010 by Nayuki and katie

Access database file and CSV sample files are included.

Program assumes that the Access file is at: C:\Openvibe\OpenVibe.accdb
