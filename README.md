# BrainwaveAnalyzer
       
Program to import raw brainwaves, and using FFT and Frequency Index calculate various bands of brainwaves.
The Brainwave Analyzer is a rough untested program.

Version 2  - May 2016 (Not a working version)

Written in C# 2010

Access file and csv sample files included.

Program assumes that access file is at:
C:\Openvibe\OpenVibe.accdb

The Brainwave Analyzer is a free open source program 
written by Nayuki and katie

Based on software written by Project Nayuki:

And the Brainwave Analyzer is a project of alphagammawaves Blog:

The purpose of the Brainwave Analyzer is to provide a way to take raw brainwaves, calculate their frequencies, divide them up into the different bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma), and then graph the results.

For now the Brainwave Analyzer is set up to import OpenVibe csv files, but will eventually be able to import raw brainwaves from other programs. The Brainwave Analyzer can also export results to a csv file for further analysis.
